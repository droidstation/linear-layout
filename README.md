Open file 'activity_main.xml' located in res/layout. Change layout to Linear Layout, by default layout is set to ConstraintLayout. now add 3 buttons one by one in Linear Layout without 'android:orientation' attribute. In result it will set orientation to horizontal by default.

if you want to change orientation of layout, set 'android:orientation' attribute to vertical in Linear Layout
